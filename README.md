# SPOTIFY ME - Project Overview and Future Plans

## Overview

**SPOTIFY ME** is an ambitious project that connects to your Spotify account and offers a range of exciting features. It can create personalized playlists based on descriptive text provided by the user, utilizing genre seeds, track features such as energy, danceability, and loudness. The integration with the Bard API enables natural language processing, allowing users to describe their desired playlist, specific artists, or even use data from their current listening habits to curate the perfect playlist. The algorithm efficiently sorts and selects the best songs to add, delivering a tailored and enjoyable music experience.

### Key Features:

1. **Playlist Generation with Descriptive Text:** Users can describe the desired playlist or specify particular artists, and the system generates playlists based on their input, taking into account various features to find the best-suited songs.

2. **Standby Mode:** The project includes a standby mode that displays the current playing status, providing users with real-time information about the currently playing track.

## Completed Tasks:

1. **Spotify API Module:** A custom-made Spotify API module automates the connection process, managing access tokens, refresh tokens, and authorization codes. It also ensures secure logging for debugging purposes.

2. **Logging Module:** The logging module saves logs to files and optionally to the console, helping in tracking and debugging errors.

3. **JSON Module:** The JSON module facilitates data extraction from JSON data, simplifying data handling.

4. **Bard API Integration:** The Bard API connection module enables natural language processing, allowing the system to understand user text and generate personalized playlists.

## Future Plans:

1. **Stats Feature:** Future implementations include adding a statistics feature that analyzes users' listening habits, providing insights into their top artists, tracks, and more. This feature will use the Requests module to connect to the Spotify API and gather the necessary data.

2. **GUI with PyQT6 or PySide:** The project aims to enhance user experience by transforming it into a fully functional consumer product with an intuitive graphical user interface, utilizing PyQT6 or PySide.

3. **API Enhancements:** The project plans to switch to more suitable APIs, such as PALM API or VERTEX API, to improve functionality and performance.

## Challenges Faced:

1. **API Management:** Handling requests and processing responses, managing callbacks, and ensuring the proper functioning of access tokens and refresh tokens were complex tasks.

2. **Module Creation:** Developing complete and modular modules for Spotify and Bard API connections, logging, and JSON data extraction required meticulous planning and execution.

3. **User Data Processing:** Extracting meaningful data from user input and parsing it for playlist generation posed challenges in data handling.

4. **Project Scale:** Managing a larger project than previously undertaken necessitated careful organization and division into libraries and data modules.

## Takeaways:

The development of SPOTIFY ME has provided valuable insights and learnings, including:

- **API Integration:** Gained experience in effectively integrating with APIs and managing various aspects of API connections.

- **Modularity:** Emphasized the importance of creating modular and organized code for ease of maintenance and scalability.

- **Error Handling:** Developed strategies to handle errors, debug issues, and maintain secure log files.

- **Natural Language Processing:** Leveraged the Bard API for better user interaction and understanding of descriptive texts.

## Conclusion:

SPOTIFY ME is an ongoing project that aims to provide a seamless and personalized music experience to its users. The completed features demonstrate the project's potential, and the future implementations promise exciting enhancements. By combining the power of the Spotify API, Bard API, and planned GUI integration, SPOTIFY ME aspires to become a comprehensive and user-friendly music companion for all music enthusiasts.

**Please Note:** The provided code serves as a representation of the current progress of the project and showcases the developer's ongoing efforts to create a powerful and user-centric music application. The future plans and features will undoubtedly add significant value to SPOTIFY ME, enhancing its capabilities and making it a standout project in the world of music applications.
