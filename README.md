# SPOTIFY ME
SPOTIFY ME is an ambitious project that seamlessly connects to users' Spotify accounts, offering a wide array of exciting and personalized features. Its primary functionality lies in the creation of customized playlists based on user-provided descriptive text, taking advantage of genre seeds and track features such as energy, danceability, and loudness. Leveraging the integration with the Bard API, the system empowers users to describe their desired playlists, specify particular artists, or even curate the perfect playlist based on their current listening habits. The algorithm at the heart of SPOTIFY ME efficiently sorts through vast musical possibilities and skillfully selects the most fitting songs, delivering a tailored and enjoyable music experience.

## Key Features
### Playlist Generation with Descriptive Text:
Users can describe the desired playlist or specify particular artists, and the system generates playlists based on their input, taking into account various features to find the best-suited songs.
### Standby Mode:
The project includes a standby mode that displays the current playing status, providing users with real-time information about the currently playing track.
### Stats Feature:
Future implementations include adding a statistics feature that analyzes users' listening habits, providing insights into their top artists, tracks, and more. This feature will use the Requests module to connect to the Spotify API and gather the necessary data.
## GUI with PyQT6 or PySide: 
The project aims to enhance user experience by transforming it into a fully functional consumer product with an intuitive graphical user interface, utilizing PyQT6 or PySide.
Challenges Faced
## API Management: 
Handling requests and processing responses, managing callbacks, and ensuring the proper functioning of access tokens and refresh tokens were complex tasks.
#Module Creation: Developing complete and modular modules for Spotify and Bard API connections, logging, and JSON data extraction required meticulous planning and execution.
## User Data Processing:
Extracting meaningful data from user input and parsing it for playlist generation posed challenges in data handling.
#Project Scale: Managing a larger project than previously undertaken necessitated careful organization and division into libraries and data modules.

## Takeaways
The development of SPOTIFY ME has provided valuable insights and learnings, including:

## API Integration: 
Gained experience in effectively integrating with APIs and managing various aspects of API connections.
## Modularity:
Emphasized the importance of creating modular and organized code for ease of maintenance and scalability.
## Error Handling: 
Developed strategies to handle errors, debug issues, and maintain secure log files.
## Natural Language Processing:
Leveraged the Bard API for better user interaction and understanding of descriptive texts.

## Conclusion
SPOTIFY ME is an ongoing project that aims to provide a seamless and personalized music experience to its users. The completed features demonstrate the project's potential, and the future implementations promise exciting enhancements. By combining the power of the Spotify API, Bard API, and planned GUI integration, SPOTIFY ME aspires to become a comprehensive and user-friendly music companion for all music enthusiasts.
